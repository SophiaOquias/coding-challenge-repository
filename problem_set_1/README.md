# Problem Set 1: Palindrome Pairs 

## Problem Description
Identify pairs of strings in an array that if concatenated form a palindrome. 

## Solution Overview
Each string is compared with another string in the array and concatenated. 
The result of concatinating two strings is then checked if it is a palindrome. If 
it is a palindrome, it is appended to a list of palindrome pairs. The same is done 
for all other strings in the array.
