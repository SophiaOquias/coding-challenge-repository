## Overview 
- Problem Set 1: Palindrome Pairs
  - Identify pairs of strings in an array that if concatenated form a palindrome. 
- Problem Set 2: Valid Parentheses 
  - Check if a string of brackets (i.e. '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}') are closed by its matching bracket and is closed in the correct order.  
- Problem Set 3: Longest Increasing Subsequence 
  - Given an unsorted array of integers, determine the length of the longest increasing subsequence. 

## Notes
Each folder contains the solutions to each problem written in Go and Java. Instructions to run each solution are located in the `README` of their respective folders. I wrote my solutions is Go first, as it was the most unfamiliar to me. Then, I wrote my solutions again in Java. 

For Java, I used openjdk version "11.0.24" and go1.18.1 linux/amd64 for Go.
